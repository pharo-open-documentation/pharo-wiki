# Basic interactions with the OS
This page describes basic interactions with the OS. The code snippet below should be working on all OS and are built-in: you do not need to install an external project to use them.

- [Execute shell command](#execute-shell-command)
- [Write environment variable](#write-environment-variable)
- [Read environment variable](#read-environment-variable)

## Execute shell command
The following code execute a shell command and returns an integer which is the return code of the executed command.
If the return code is `0`, the execution of the command is successful. Else, the integer returned is the error code generated by the shell command.

```Smalltalk
LibC uniqueInstance
	system: 'echo "foo" >> /tmp/foo.txt'
```

## Write environment variable
The environment behaves similarly to a dictionary when it comes to write a variable.

```Smalltalk
Smalltalk os environment at: 'FOO' put: 'bar'.
Smalltalk os environment at: 'FOO' ifAbsentPut: 'bar'
```

> Note: Before Pharo 7, `#setEnv:value:` message was used. This message is part of the low-level API and should not be used directly.

## Read environment variable
As for writing a variable, environment provide an API similar to `Dictionary` to read a variable.

```Smalltalk
Smalltalk os environment at: 'FOO'.
Smalltalk os environment at: 'FOO' ifAbsent: [ 'Nope :-(' ].
Smalltalk os environment at: 'FOO' ifPresent: [ :value | "Do something interesting." ]
```

> Note: Before Pharo 7, #getEnv: message was used. This message is now deprecated and should not be used.
