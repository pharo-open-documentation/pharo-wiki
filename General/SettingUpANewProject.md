# Setting up a new project

In this article, we describe the good workflow for setting up a new project in Pharo. We will guide you through the whole process from getting a new Pharo image, creating the GitHub repository, and setting up the CI.

We will demonstrate everything by setting up a toy project - `Counter`, inspired by Chapter 14. Seaside by Example of [Pharo by Example](https://files.pharo.org/books-pdfs/updated-pharo-by-example/2017-01-14-UpdatedPharoByExample.pdf) book. It is a simple class that has a value which can be incremented or decremented.

## Step 0. Download and install Pharo Launcher

In order to work with Pharo, you should dowload and install Pharo Launcher - a tool for managing Pharo images. It is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS in both 32bit and 64bit version and can be dowloaded from [http://pharo.org/download]().

![](SettingUp_DownloadPharo.png)

## Step 1. Get a fresh Pharo image

Instructions in this tutorial were written for Pharo 8, 64bit. But they should also work fine for Pharo 7. We suggest that you start your new project with the latest development version of Pharo.

Open your Pharo Launcher. You will see two panels:

- **New Image Templates** on the left - here you can select a template of a new image that you want to create on your machine.
- **Current Images** on the right - created images will appear here. By double-clicking on image name, you can launch it.

Open the list of `Official distributions` in the left panel and double-click on the latest development version of Pharo. In our case, this is `Pharo 8.0 - 64bit (development version, latest)`. Give a nice descriptive name to your new image and press `OK`. You can now find your image in the right panel. Launch it by double-clicking on the image name.

## Step 2. Create a package and a class

!! ( In Pharo 13 or more latest version, we have "**slots: { #variable }**" instead of "**instanceVariableNames: 'variable'**" )

Let us make our first package. In your newly made image in Pharo Launcher, in the top menu bar choose *Tools* then *System Browser*.

![System Browser tool for developing projects in Pharo](SettingUp_SystemBrowser.png)

System Browser is the main tool to develop a project in Pharo. It allows browsing packages, classes, protocols and methods. The most left panel shows all the packages that already exist. To create a new one, press the right click of a mouse on this part, and choose the option New Package. 

![Pharo System Browser, new package creation pop-up menu](SettingUp_NewPackage.png)

Choosing it, a new small window will open, where you give a name to the package you are creating. Type the name *Counter* and press ok.


To create a class, first you need to choose the package in which it will be located. Then look at the bottom part of the System Browser in it there is a template for creating a class. It gives us all the information we need: superclass, variables, package. Creating a new class is as easy as filling out this template. Continuing with our example, we will create a new class *MyCounter*. The superclass is *Object*, so we will not change that. But we will change the name of the class. You will notice that saving our class, the second left part of SystemBrowser is no longer empty.

![Pharo System Browser, new class created](SettingUp_AddingClass.png)

## Step 3. Write some failing tests

If we want to follow the [TDD (test driven development)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_development), we first need to create tests. All tests are stored in a test class, which is a subclass of *TestCase*. This class can be generated by doing a right-click on the class name and selecting *Jump to test class*. This option will generate a test class in a new package *Counter-Tests*.

![Pharo System Browser, new Test class created](SettingUp_TestClass.png)

Next what we need to do is create some tests. We do this by clicking on out test class, choosing a protocol in second from the right part of the Browser, and implementing a test. 

In case there are no protocols to choose from (this happens in cases when we are making our first test), then we need to add a new one. This is done by pressing a right click on *instance side*, going to New protocol option and picking a protocol you need (in our case tests).

![Pharo System Browser, new protocol creation pop-up menu](SettingUp_NewProtocol.png)

After we have choosen a protocol, our bottom part of System Browser will change and show a template for making methods (each test is a separate method). When giving a name it is important to put the word *test* first, so that Pharo knows that what we are making is in fact a test.

In our example, a counter will be incrementing and decrementing some value. You will notice that we are using methods which have not been created yet and that each test you write will fail (be red) when you run it. 

We can make these tests: 

**Creating MyCounter object:** 
We want to check if the object we created is not equal to nil, that is why we are using *self deny:* message. This will to a check if the statement we send is true and if it is return false. 

  
  ```GitHub
  testCreatingMyCounter
    "A test that will check if the creation of an object MyCounter is done properly"
    |tmp|
    tmp := MyCounter new.
    self deny: (tmp = nil)
  ```


**Incrementing value:** 
Here we want to check if the method *increment* is really doing his job and adding one to the value. What we did here is: created a new object MyCounter, set the test value, call the method *increment* and checked if the new value is equal to an expected result. Here we use *self assert:* key word message, which returns true if the statement is in fact true. 


```GitHub
testIncrementing
  "A test that will check if method increment is working properly. 
    Test value 5. Expected result 6."
  |counter|
  counter := MyCounter new.
  counter value: 5.
  counter increment.
  self assert: (counter value = 6)
  ```


**Decrementing value:**
Here we are checking if the method *decrement* is doing his job and subtracting one from the value. The process of creating this test is similar to previous one.


```GitHub
testDecrementing
  "A test that will check if method decrement is working properly.
   Test value 5. Expested result is 4."
  |counter|
  counter := MyCounter new.
  counter value: 5.
  counter decrement.
  self assert: (counter value = 4)
```


## Step 4. Add methods to make tests green

Now that we have create tests (which are all red), we need to implement methods that we have been testing. Switch to *MyCounter* class for this part.

The first thing that you probably have noticed already is that most of our methods are working with some kind of value. This is a number which we are assigning to our counter. Therefore, value is an instance variable of a class MyCounter. Choose your class and add this variable.

![Pharo System Browser, new variable added to class](SettingUp_AddingVariable.png)

If we have a variable, we need to assure access to it, by making *value* and *value: anInteger* methods. They will allow putting some integer as a new value (*value: anInteger*) and retrieving the current value (*value*).


```GitHub
value
  "Method that returns variable value."
  ^value
  ```
  
  
  ```GitHub
  value: anInteger
    "Method that sets *anInteger* as a variable value."
    value := anInteger
  ```


To make the first test work, we need to implement initialization of an object. Method *init* will be in initialization protocol and it will assign some default integer to the variable value.


```GitHub
init
  "Method for initialization.
  Setting variables to some default values. For example 0."
  value := 0
  ```

Now we will show the implementation on method *increment*. This method is adding one to variable value and putting this new number as value. Implementation for method *decrement* will be similar.


```GitHub
increment
  "This method adds 1 to variable value."
  self value: (value + 1)
  ```

```GitHub
decrement
  "This method subtracts 1 from variable value."	
  self value: (value - 1)
  ```

After you have added all the methods, go to your test class and run your tests. Notice that all of them are green now.

## Step 5. Create a baseline and a Metacello script

Baselines allow us to manage dependencies and specify how the repository should be loaded. We can use `Metacello` object to load the project that has a baseline defined for it. In this tutorial we will only show an example of creating a baseline for our simple `Counter` project. For more information on baselines, please read this excellent [Baselines](https://github.com/pharo-open-documentation/pharo-wiki/blob/master/General/Baselines.md) guide on Pharo Wiki.

Start by creating a package called `BaselineOf<YourProjectName>` and the class with the same name which is the subclass of `BaselineOf`. In our case, both package and class are called `BaselineOfCounter`.

```Smalltalk
BaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfCounter
    instanceVariableNames: ''
    classVariableNames: ''
    package: 'BaselineOfCounter'
```

Now create a method `BaselineOfCounter >> baseline:` with the following content:

```Smalltalk
baseline: spec
    <baseline>
    spec for: #common do: [	
				
        "Packages"
        spec
            package: 'Counter';
            package: 'Counter-Tests' with: [ spec requires: #('Counter') ] ].
```

At this point, our baseline does not contain any external dependencies. It only says that our project consists of two packages: `Counter` and `Counter-Tests` and that the package `Counter-Tests` depends on `Counter`.

## Step 6. Create repository on GitHub

To create the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/), first you need to visit the site and either *sign in* (if you already have an account) or *sign up* (to make a new account). Go to your profile and choose Repositories.

![Repositories menu GitHub](SettingUp_NewRepoGit.png)

In the right corner there will be a button *New*, press it to create a new repository. 

In newly opened window add name; description and README if you choose. You can also decide who will see your repository (Public - everyone; Private - you select people who will have access). After filling the necessary information, press *create repository* button.

![GitHub, new repository creation form](SettingUp_CreateNewRepo.png)

## Step 7. Load the repository into your image

## Step 8. Create an src/ folder and add metadata to your repository

It is a good practice to put all your source packages into a separate folder, usually called `src/`. This ensures that as the number of packages grows, people will not have to scroll a lot to see README. It also makes repository structure cleaner because source code is separated from documentation, licence, etc. You can navigate into the working directory of your repository and create the `src/` folder manually or execute the following line in your Playground to have Pharo create the folder for you:

```Smalltalk
(FileLocator localDirectory / 'iceberg' / '<userName>' / '<projectName>' / 'src') ensureCreateDirectory 
```

## Step 9. Add packages and do the first commit

## Step 10. Set up the continuous integration (CI)

## Step 11. Add badges to your README.md
